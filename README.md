# rusty-earth
'rusty-earth' is a GIS application written in Rust, aiming at developing physically accurate 3D representation of the Earth.

This project is intended to serve as a playground for me learning:
  - Differential geometry for space curves and surfaces;
  - Rust programming language;
  - Basic conventions in geoinformatics and mapping techniques
